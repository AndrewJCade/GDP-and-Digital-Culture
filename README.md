# GDP-and-Digital-Culture
Disclaimer:
This project represents an independent econometric study conducted for educational purposes. The analysis investigates the impact of cultural elements within digital behaviors on the Real GDP Growth Rate of nations. All work presented here, including data merging, analysis, and the final report, was performed independently.

Summary:
This project involved the utilization of standard OLS regression techniques and data visualization tools to observe the significance of digital cultural behaviors on a given country's production. The program helped conclude statistical signifance after a comprehensive merge of several international datasets into the econometric model.

Objective:
The study investigates how digital cultural factors influence economic growth. It examines existing literature and introduces five new variables, including:

1. Mobile Connectivity Index score
2. Human Development Index scores
3. Percentages of populations engaging with YouTube
4. Web-streamed television
5. Web-streamed music
The model used is a Cobb-Douglas function incorporating ICT expenditures for technology and the aforementioned variables.

Materials Included:
1. STATA Code: The .do files containing the STATA code for modeling GDP growth with independent cultural variables this is under the Main Branch.
2. Data Files: The dataset files, including .dta files used for analysis. The final, merged dataset includes over 8,000 observations sourced from multiple international datasets, this is under the Data Merging Branch.
3. CSV Files: For easy viewing, the dataset has been exported to .csv format.
4. Presentation Slides: A presentation of key findings, which was presented at the 2024 Stander Symposium.
